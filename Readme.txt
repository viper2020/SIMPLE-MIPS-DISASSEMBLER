****************MIPS DISASSEMBLER****************

I have developed this code in python in linux environment

Before executing the file.Please type the following commands in the terminal

1)sudo apt-get update
2)sudo apt-get install -y git python-pip
3)git clone https://github.com/scott-griffiths/bitstring
4)cd bitstring
5)sudo python setup.py install
6)pip install bitstring

Now save the file disassembler.py and the input file fib_bin.txt in a seperate folder

In the terminal navigate to the folder(in which files are saved)using the 'cd' command ,and type python disassembler.py in the terminal and click enter

The output text file fib_out.txt is generated in the folder and you can observe the output

THANK YOU
